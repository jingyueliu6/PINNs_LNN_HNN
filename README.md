# Physics-informed Neural Networks to Model and Control Robots:a Theoretical and Experimental Investigation

## Abstract
This work concerns the application of physics-informed neural networks to the modeling and control of complex robotic systems. Achieving this goal required extending Physics Informed Neural Networks to handle non-conservative effects. We propose to combine these learned models with model-based controllers originally developed with first-principle models in mind. By combining standard and new techniques, we can achieve precise control performance while proving theoretical stability bounds. These validations include real-world experiments of motion prediction with a soft robot and of trajectory tracking with a Franka Emika manipulator.
